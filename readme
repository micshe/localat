localat
******* 
a semi-threadsafe posix socket wrapper, transparently adding support for local sockets 
relative to an arbitrary directory file-descriptor, in the vein of the ___at() family 
of filesystem functions introduced in posix 2008.


introduction
************ 
the openat(), mkdirat(), mkfifoat(), linkat(), symlinkat(), unlinkat(), etc functions
introduced in posix 2008 are really handy.  but the ____at() function for creating
local sockets relative to an opened directory is suspiciously absent, leaving one to
roll one's own if its needed (tmux, at least, does this).

for instructions on how to build and install localat, type
 $ make help
or
 $ make

to build, type
 $ make all

to test, type
 $ make test

to install, type
 $ sudo make install
(and then run ldconfig, or do whatever is required on your system)


documentation
*************
liblocalat provides 1 #defined constant, 1 struct, and 3 functions, that mirror the 
standard posix socket api.

the functions are:

 socket2(int domain, int type, int protocol);

which works just like posix's socket(), except it also accepts AF_LOCALAT or AF_UNIXAT 
as domains.

 bind2(int socket, void* sockaddr, socklen_t length);

which works just like posix's bind(), except it also accepts struct sockaddr_unat* 
arguments.  and uses a void* so one doesn't need to explicitly cast.

 connect2(int socket, void* sockaddr, socklen_t length);

which works just like posix's connect(), except it also accepts struct sockaddr_unat* 
arguments.  and uses a void* so one doesn't need to explicitly cast.  

the structures and constants are:

 #define AF_LOCALAT
 #define AF_UNIXAT

 struct sockaddr_unat
 {
   sa_family_t sunat_family;
   int dirfd;
   char path[108];
 };

where @dirfd should be set to the fd of an open directory that @path[] will be treated
as being relative to.  like the other posix ____at() functions, if the path is absolute
(ie starts with a / character) then dirfd will be ignored, and if dirfd is set to the 
constant AT_FDWCD, the path will be treated as being relative to the process's current 
working directory.

all any of these functions do is check if the family is AF_LOCALAT or AF_UNIXAT, and
delegate to the standard posix functions if it is not.  so they are fine to *try* to 
use as global replacements for socket,connect,bind if you so wish.


examples
********
see the source of test.c for examples of using socket2,connect2,bind2 for creating
local and localat sockets.


threadsafety
************ 
liblocalat is partially threadsafe: the functions can be called simultaneously from
multiple threads without error, but if a background thread forks and execs some file
descriptors will leak.  this is an unavoidable consequence of the close-on-exec flag
being an "opt-in" state-- rather than the default state-- of newly created, duplicated,
or received fds under posix.  linux provides some non-posix flags to avoid this, but 
i'm not sure if the BSDs (or OSX) do the same.

the whole point of the ____at() functions is to provide threadsafe filesystem access
functions, so this whole 'not being fully threadsafe thing' is a bit unfortunate.


portability
***********
should work on any posix system, with the exception of cygwin, which does not support
passing file-descriptors over local sockets.  it might be possible to avoid this by
transfering the socket via the /proc filesystem.  i haven't looked into it yet.

the makefile *probably* doesn't work on OSX.


future work
***********
support for struct sockaddr_unat should be provided by the kernel in posix systems,
so this lib should really be just a way of demo-ing the interface.
